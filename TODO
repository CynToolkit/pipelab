☐ IMPORTANT
    ☐ To cross compile tauri or electron, I don't want a backend or my own CI
    ☐ The idea is to have confgurations store online on your account
    ☐ On Github Actions or any other CI service, have an action that is
    ☐ pipelab/setup and pipelab/run that install all dependencies and that run a config
    ☐ Infos are from the variables: account, pipeline & api key
    ☐ It will run the pipeline as if it was your computer

process.noAsar = true is here because electron fs can't deal correctly with asar (for example, like when copying an asar archive)
